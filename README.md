# EigenLayer Improvement Proposals (ELIPs)

This repository tracks EigenLayer Improvement Proposals ongoing improvements to EigenLayer core contracts.

## Whatâ€™s an ELIP?
EigenLayer Improvement Proposals (ELIPs) are the primary mechanisms for proposing new features/upgrades to the EigenLayer core contracts. ELIPs are version-controlled design documents that detail the technical specification, rationale, implementation path, and impact evaluation of new features/upgrades. ELIPs are used to:

* Track progress while designing, building, and implementing new features
* Publicly communicate new features and create space for community input
* Propose new features to the Protocol Council for approval & execution

Active proposals can be viewed in this repository's [pull requests](https://github.com/abbey-titcomb/test-eigenlayer-core-dev/pulls). 

## ELIP Process
In the early stages, ideas for ELIPs and early drafts should be discussed on forum.eigenlayer.xyz. The following actions require an ELIP:

* Upgrades/modifications to EigenLayer Core Contracts
* Modifications to multisig governance architecture (i.e. transferring ownership / admin access)
* Modifying minting rights over the bEIGEN token

Please refer to [research.eigenlayer.xyz](https://research.eigenlayer.xyz/) for developer discussion around current and future ELIPs. To stay up to date with the governance of ELIPs, head to [forum.eigenlayer.xyz](https://forum.eigenlayer.xyz/).
